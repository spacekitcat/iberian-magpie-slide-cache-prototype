Of part and parcel
So, well, we're already dead
Well, it's probably been said
That it's always been said
That
One wing isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
To leave
One wing isn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
To leave
I'm gonna shake myself right out the door
I'm gonna take myself when it's finally over
I'm gonna let my own bad self take over
I'm gonna move my arm out with my shoulder
And
One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
To leave
One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
To leave
One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
To leave
First off, Gary was on trial, and drunk before we left bed
As things got better, was it hard to say that he had no idea?
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So, we all just opened up our mouths and walked to this town
Well, I was walking just a little bit sideways, and you were walking sideways too
Well, I hadn't learned when a front door can be used
Here it goes now
We had darkened doors, so we didn't read what the sign read
Though simple enough, it was to me really tough; the ground needs to be fed
Well, I hadn't noticed, but the people really noticed that they didn't really want us around
So, not a single one of us will ever leave town
Here we go, sir
Our bodies were laid out
They were laid for fifteen yards
Well, two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar
Well, I hadn't noticed, but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So, every single one of us hit the ground
Here we go now
One wing wasn't even, uh
One wing wasn't even enough
Oh, pardon, pardon
So, well, it's already been said
That it's always been said that
We're already dead
